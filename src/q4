Less memory is required to traverse a linked list in reverse, however it is not stable so not always preferred.

Use a memory pool. Allocate an area of memory at the beginning of the program of type Node. Pointers to this area 
are stored in an array. All you have to do is get the pointers from the array. This does not improve 
the overall speed, but if you have frequent memory allocations this will increase the responsiveness of the program 
at the cost of some space for the array.
